# 😷 Face Mask Detection using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify whether a person is wearing a **face mask** or **not**. It is designed to work with images and can also be integrated with real-time video streams using **OpenCV** for monitoring public safety.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects faces with **Mask** and **Without Mask**.
- Built using **Deep Learning (CNN with TensorFlow/Keras)**.
- Can be applied in **real-time detection** using a webcam.
- Achieves high accuracy on test datasets.
- Provides **visualization of training & validation accuracy/loss**.

## 📊 Model Performance

- Training Accuracy: ~95% (varies with dataset size)

- Validation Accuracy: ~93%

- Loss and accuracy curves are plotted during training.

----

## 📸 Sample Output

- ✅ With Mask → Labeled as Mask

- ❌ Without Mask → Labeled as No Mask

----

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Improve accuracy with data augmentation.

- Deploy as a Web App / Mobile App.

- Add support for detecting incorrect mask wearing.
